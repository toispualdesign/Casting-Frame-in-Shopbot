# Casting Frame in Shopbot
In this project I made a two-part plywood casting frame for testing out molds made for metal casting.
Pictures included show the frame in use. Material used was 20 mm plywood, and separate wooden material for the dowels.
I used V-Carve to make the frames. crv file is included, and an sbp file with all the used paths combined.
