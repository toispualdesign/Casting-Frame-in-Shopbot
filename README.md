# Casting Frame in Shopbot
In this project I made a two-part plywood casting frame for testing out molds made for metal casting.
Pictures included show the frame in use. Material used was 20 mm plywood, and separate wooden material for the dowels.
I used V-Carve to make the frames. crv file is included, and an sbp file with all the used paths combined.

Picture descriptions:
F01 - Covering the mold with casting sand. Using a sieve to get the sand fine enough to cover the mold well.
F02 - Packing it all in tight.
F03 - Exposing minor details that are lower than the rest of the mold prior to removing the mold from the sand.
F04 - Larger view of the frame with the mold still in sand.
